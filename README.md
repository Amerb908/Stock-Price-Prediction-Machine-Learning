# Stock Market Prediction with Machine Learning and Python

## Overview
This project aims to predict the stock market, specifically focusing on predicting the future price movements of the S&P 500 index using machine learning techniques. The project utilizes Python programming language and various machine learning libraries.

## Introduction
In this project, we demonstrate how to predict the future price movements of the S&P 500 index using machine learning models. We start by downloading and cleaning historical data on the S&P 500 index. Then, we use machine learning algorithms to train a model and predict whether the stock price will go up or down tomorrow.

## Key Steps
1. **Data Acquisition and Cleaning**: We use the yfinance package in Python to download historical data on the S&P 500 index. The data is cleaned and visualized to understand patterns and trends.

2. **Target Definition**: Rather than predicting the absolute price, we focus on predicting the direction of the stock price movement. This is done to align with real-world trading objectives.

3. **Model Training**: We utilize machine learning models, particularly random forests, for prediction. The models are trained using historical data to learn patterns and make predictions.

4. **Evaluation and Backtesting**: The accuracy of the model is evaluated using precision score. Backtesting is performed to assess the performance of the model on historical data.

## Usage
To replicate this project or utilize the provided code, follow these steps:
1. Install necessary Python libraries (`yfinance`, `scikit-learn`, etc.).
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Run the Python scripts or notebooks provided in the repository to execute the project steps.
